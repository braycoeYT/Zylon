Q&A:

Q: What's the theme of the mod?
A: What are you, an English teacher? Shut up. The theme of the mod is that I don't care about themes.

Q: Why are you returning?
A: I didn't want to leave the game with a bad taste in my mouth, and I played the game again and it was super fun, and then ideas began to fill my head, and you can see where this went. Also, a couple people asked me to rejoin.

Q: Is the original content going to come back?
A: Some of it, yes, though I will probably remake it to fit 1.4. Sadly, the Ember Glades are most likely not going to return for a good while for complicated reasons.

Q: Is the original team going to return?
A: I can't read minds. People can rejoin if they want to. As of writing this, most of the major dev team returned (to my surprise), though most of them are busy now.

Q: Where is the discord server?
A: It should appear as the mod homepage.

Zylon/Azercadmium is back, after a year of absence. I left last time due to overworking myself, but that won't happen this time. Honestly, the fact that Azercadmium got a quarter of a million downloads is extremely surprising, considering how bad the mod was at times. Though, I have improved a lot at coding, so hopefully this will be a lot better than Azercadmium.

The best mod that starts with Z (I guarantee or your money back)!

(DESPERATELY) LOOKING FOR SPRITERS - ANYONE INTERESTED CAN JOIN THE DISCORD SERVER LINKED ON THE FORUMS.

Stats:
~216 Items
~2 Bosses: (0 worm bosses! I'm not THAT lazy!)
~~~2 Prehardmode Bosses
~~~An unobtainable joke boss (best boss ever made)
^The only two statistics anyone ever cares about: items and bosses. Here's more anyway:
~37 NPCS
~28 Buffs
~5 Tiles
~A complete reworking and expansion of blowpipes!
~Many new vanilla recipes and changes to help balance the game out (including an easier Slime Crown recipe).
~Several new prefixes!

Q&A:

Q: What's the theme of the mod?
A: What are you, an English teacher? Shut up. The theme of the mod is that I don't care about themes.

Q: Why are you returning?
A: I didn't want to leave the game with a bad taste in my mouth, and I played the game again and it was super fun, and then ideas began to fill my head, and you can see where this went. Also, a couple people asked me to rejoin.

Q: Is the original content going to come back?
A: Some of it, yes, though I will probably remake it to fit 1.4. Sadly, the Ember Glades are most likely not going to return for a good while for complicated reasons.

Q: Is the original team going to return?
A: I can't read minds. People can rejoin if they want to. As of writing this, most of the major dev team returned (to my surprise), though most of them are busy now.

(currently works on 1.4.3)
The best mod that starts with Z (I guarantee or your money back)! Zylon is a unique terraria mod full of slimes, blowpipes, references, peculiar boss fights, and much much more! Zylon is the kind of mod that makes all its boss summons infinite because who has the time to craft the same summon a billion times?!
